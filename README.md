# ZoteHub Exploit || DaModder

ZoteHub is a free keyless MultiApi Exploit. The Ui isnt completly dogwater and is developed by a ui designer not a devloper like KRNL kindly demonstrates (Not saying its better than KRNL). Yes its not a super saiyan level 8 multi api executor but it does have some slack features.
 Haha we use WeAreDevsAPI and you can cry about it because its actually not as dogwater as you think. At least WeAreDevsAPI doesnt have a very
 bugged and long key system like krnl.
